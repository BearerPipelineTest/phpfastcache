        ### Before you start

        **Are you looking for development help?**
        ‚Ü© Please note that we cannot provide assistance on web development. We recommend asking around on a dedicated help forum like StackOverflow.

        ### Issue etiquette
        
        When opening an feature request, please:
        - Follow the project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as well as the [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).
        - Check for an [existing feature request](https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache/issues) first. If someone else has opened a similar feature request, please upvote their feature request rather than creating another one.
        - Keep suggestions relevant to the project. Irrelevant suggestions will be automatically closed and marked as spam, and repeated offenses may result in exclusion from our organization.
        - Provide as much detail as possible. The more detail you are able to provide, the better!
        - **Make sure that a request feature may be denied or accepted and if id does it can take a while before being implemented.**
